#Billy's Billing PHP SDK

PHP SDK for [Billy's Billing API](http://dev.billysbilling.dk/) version 1 only from the Danish accounting program [Billy's Billing](http://www.billysbilling.dk/).

Read [API Terms](https://dev.billysbilling.dk/api-terms) before use. For further information, see [API Docs](https://dev.billysbilling.dk/api).

**Note:** This SDK only works with API v1. We have a new SDK in the works for v2. See also [v2 documentation](https://gist.github.com/sebastianseilund/7478452).

##Installation
Download code and include bootstrap.php; example using require():
```
require("path/to/billysbilling-php/bootstrap.php");
```
It might be preferable to use a relative path from the current file to include the SDK, especially when using the SDK in a module or extension:
```
require(dirname(__FILE__) . "/path/to/billysbilling-php/bootstrap.php");
```
